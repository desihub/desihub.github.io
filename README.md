# data.desi.lbl.gov status

https://data.desi.lbl.gov is currently down due to problems with the underlying Spin service at NERSC.
In the meantime, you can browse the DESI data documentation at http://desi-data.csdc.noirlab.edu/doc
and see the status of NERSC at https://nersc.gov/status .

NERSC staff are actively working on resolving the underlying problems, but we do not currently have
an estimate for when the service will be restored. We apologize for the inconvenience.
